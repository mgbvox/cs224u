2341,2341,a wildly funny prison caper .
2342,2342,I wish the owner only good things for this place.
2343,2343,"From the news, we went there for our husbands only wish."
2344,2344,this is art paying homage to art .
2345,2345,"We were hoping to have an amazing time at this highly-rated restaurant, but our server was a bit frazzled.  "
2346,2346,"It was a lovely restaurant with a great staff. But, for the price, the food could have been better. It lacked seasoning and flavor."
2347,2347,moderately involving despite bargain-basement photography and hackneyed romance .
2348,2348,I arrived right on schedule.
2349,2349,Seating is a bit cramped.
2350,2350,"Just visiting Baltimore and found this restaurant via Zagat. I was traveling alone for work, and had a lovely meal with great service."
2351,2351,Never disappointing
2352,2352,"Food was good, disappointed by the service."

2356,2356,I don't want to waste my time or more money in Illinois if I won't like them.
2357,2357,They had checked the sensors and could not find why it was happening and recommended me to Ford.
2358,2358,i do n't have an i am sam clue .
2359,2359,"Not a place where they love to recommend things, they like to keep the line moving so decide what you want before you get up to order."
2360,2360,This place was recommended to me by my property management company for our move out cleaning.
2361,2361,has little on its mind aside from scoring points with drag gags .
2362,2362,"The food is not authentically Italian. It is for those who think it is Italian but actually do not know and can be fooled by appearances. Would not go back, would not recommend."
2363,2363,Frozen meat patties are disgusting except for this brand.
2364,2364,Reasonable prices given the quality and quantity. i'd recommend
2365,2365,tender yet lacerating and darkly funny fable .
2366,2366,what 's most striking about this largely celebratory film ... is the sense of isolation that permeates these bastions of individuality in an ikea world .
2367,2367,"Extremely disappointing. Food was very average and, given the quality, overpriced. We would have been better off going to Olive Garden."
2368,2368,an extraordinary swedish film about the soul adventure of marriage -- the kind of intimate and character-driven film that bille august does best .
2369,2369,3 mechanics sitting around and can get it.
2370,2370,"Not a restaurant I would reccommend. Overpriced. No ,""wow' ,factor. Average at best."
2371,2371,The beef was on the tougher side.
2372,2372,Just realize that you have to fork out a little more buck to get that.
2373,2373,Our particular server was very regimented. No personality. Food was good but overpriced.
2374,2374,"the movie is too cute to take itself too seriously , but it still feels like it was made by some very stoned college students ."
2375,2375,the omelette I ordered was overcooked - I've had better at IHOP.
2376,2376,"Average service, average food, average environment. If you don't have anything better..."
2377,2377,i 've heard that the fans of the first men in black have come away hating the second one .
2378,2378,"If you see someone giving you that look when you're asking something, all you need to do is ask for an English speaker."
2379,2379,I'm not a foodie at all.
2380,2380,"Prior to coming I called to see if they were still honoring the evening menu, or would they have a special menu, I was told it was the same menu, not a special one...great!"
2381,2381,Menlo Park closes fairly early anyway...

2387,2387,And it's definitely one of my favorites here in Naples.
2388,2388,We enjoyed the food very much and the service was very good. Overall was just kind of an ordinary experience but not disappointing.

2398,2398,I ask for special request at reservation to have desert ordered secretly to celebrate birthday with my girl friend.
2399,2399,The NY branch on the other hand is an outstanding experience.
2400,2400,This place has lost a lot of its value over the years. Food is staid and not innovative.
2401,2401,french onion soup was great; frisee salad was very average to fair...like someone dumped frisee on the plate and threw and egg and some bacon on top. Not much there....
2402,2402,I decided to give Noble Carpet Cleaning a try because it was possible that they might provide good service.

2406,2406,We have eaten at Sassi's multiple ties but this was the best ever.
2407,2407,"Well, since my schedule's a little rock 'n' roll, I can't get over there (I will someday), so I had to try Coca Cafe's version, and I must say that it was a tempter if there ever was one."
2408,2408,Service was very disapointing & unattentative; food was below expectations; very expensive
2409,2409,this is such a dazzlingly self-assured directorial debut that it 's hard to know what to praise first .
2410,2410,"as is most commonly case with projects such noble and lofty ambitions , the film is less poetic than simply pretentious ."
2411,2411,A little too expensive for the quality of the food which is good to very good. Service is slow and unresponsive to deadlines.
2412,2412,They also said obviously OfficeMax doesn't trust its employees and they have too much time on their hands to look at the content of the documents.
2413,2413,"... a joke at once flaky and resonant , lightweight and bizarrely original ."
2414,2414,I couldn't cut my yellow fin tuna with a steak knife it was so sinewy. No one offered to take our coats and the tables are so small there was no where to place them. I won't be back.
2415,2415,"The food was ok! We waited 55 mins to get served. The restarant wasnt even crowded. When we finally said something, they just said sorry. Coffee was also awful, burnt!"
2416,2416,You gave your competitors a new customer.
2417,2417,We will definitely return this great find.
2418,2418,"Overall, a disappointment. Food alternated between predictable (onion soup) and ""tried too hard"" (risotto special)."
2419,2419,"After I had complained, a table magically opened up."
2420,2420,Online reservations are the only way to go.
2421,2421,Not impressed. This was our third time...and last...at Kuleto's. Surly wait staff and mediocre food. Definately has gone downhill in our book.
2422,2422,Don't go for the food. The champagne cocktails are good but the food is marginal.
2423,2423,a refreshingly honest and ultimately touching tale of the sort of people usually ignored in contemporary american film .
2424,2424,"My coworkers and I decided, though, that they probably just serve whatever they can pick up on the street."
2425,2425,"Good food, but it took over an hour to get our food... and it was not very crowded."
2426,2426,"this is a throwaway , junk-food movie whose rap soundtrack was better tended to than the film itself ."
2427,2427,The only thing I have an issue with is the spice level isn't always the same.
2428,2428,Excellent food and atmosphere. Definitely will go there again.
2429,2429,"For lack of a better way to put it, SOOOOOOO GOOOOD!"

2432,2432,Went here for the lunch buffet.
2433,2433,Can't believe it 's not butter

2435,2435,He didn't spend anytime with us asking about our night but he took the time to build rapport with the two groups behind us.
2436,2436,Doozy of a Deal was nice and gave me a refund.
2437,2437,this clever caper movie has twists worthy of david mamet and is enormous fun for thinking audiences .
2438,2438,"the film is surprisingly well-directed by brett ratner , who keeps things moving well -- at least until the problematic third act ."
2439,2439,We had conversations with people at night and got kicked out!
2440,2440,I was in desperate need of a haircut since the last time I got one was six months ago.
2441,2441,"windtalkers is shapelessly gratifying , the kind of movie that invites you to pick apart its faults even as you have to admit that somehow it hit you where you live ."
2442,2442,Decided to not go to my car dealer anymore for my oil change because they took too long.
2443,2443,I was disappointed. I expected better food and service.
2444,2444,"We are visiting from CA, so we just went to the closest ER to our hotel, which was Tempe St Luke's."
2445,2445,I have been asked if I've been helped three times while waiting for my order.
2446,2446,"food was quite good. off the beaten track and pretty good value
waiter didn't know how to decant wine and promptly dumped old wine (brought in) with sediment into decanter, alas."
2447,2447,The quality was food was terrible
2448,2448,"The waitress, bartender, and chef were more like old friends that wanted everything perfect for you."
2449,2449,Room seemed a bit too bright.
2450,2450,"Chanda lives on site so she is always around causing a stir, being hands on with your position is great in most cases however in this case Chanda is just ""M""essy!"
2451,2451,Food was mediocre and overpriced. This place seems more interested in being a club/bar than a restaurant.
2452,2452,My friend and I were looking for something to eat after a movie late at night and we wanted something cheap. It was fun.
2453,2453,I will say the Butcher has a reason to be Arrogant.
2454,2454,"if this holiday movie is supposed to be a gift , somebody unwrapped it early , took out all the good stuff , and left behind the crap -lrb- literally -rrb- ."
2455,2455,It was also $10 more expensive than the Hess chardonney that we thought we had ordered.
2456,2456,Hipsters approve.
2457,2457,Nothing spectacular. The chocolate pudding is incredibly rich and yummy.
2458,2458,Is it even fair to expect a fish place would have amazing wings?
2459,2459,I guess they didn't spend money on sound proofing. It is too loud here.
2460,2460,yes. 'm a guest and they won't accomomdate me until I give them the time I need them to show up
2461,2461,"We appreciated the quiet table, but the service was only fair and the food just acceptable."
2462,2462,neither funny nor suspenseful nor particularly well-drawn .
2463,2463,"Food was pretty good but rich. Problem was the NOISE level. Tables were far enough apart but the noise just reverberated throughout the restaurant.
Also, it would be nice if they validated parking!"
2464,2464,The people of Yelp had clearly spoken.
2465,2465,kids are allowed
2466,2466,"Maybe other spots are for special occasions, groups or reserved."
2467,2467,Meaning each meat and side had to pay for separate.
2468,2468,To each his or her own but the only negative thing i have to say about reggies is PUT SOME BLACKTOP DOWN ON YOUR PARKING LOT!!!!!
2469,2469,Great ambience but very average at best food. The best thing on the menu is the mac n cheese...delisshhhh!
2470,2470,I'm really glad I got a chance to stop in and look forward my my next visit! It rocked.
2471,2471,I ordered steak with frites. The steak was good but the fries were both soggy and not the typical French style. My starter salad was just OK.
2472,2472,Haven't tried the wine bar.
2473,2473,Unbelievable experience!!!
2474,2474,I plan to return.
2475,2475,food very good service very poor
2476,2476,This place has been on my list to check out for a long time since it's all you can eat shabu.
2477,2477,This town needs an enema!!
2478,2478,"why come up with something even quasi-original , when you can pillage from shirley jackson , richard matheson ... and puke up something like rose red ?"
2479,2479,"Our waiters were really great, and fun, but it took WAaaay too long for Lunch to arrive, and nobody 'explained'.... Tues., 3/9, 1:30."
2480,2480,"Great food, great service, but the high level of noise from the bar area made it nearly impossible to hold a conversation at our table.

This isn't a dining experience that we will be repeating."
2481,2481,"If you're looking for quality service and the meal you were looking forward to, go to another location!"
2482,2482,I've been a big fan of McCormick & Schmick's for the past few years.
2483,2483,the whole damn thing is ripe for the jerry springer crowd .
2484,2484,See ya!
2485,2485,She was quite forgetful and got the food order wrong. very poor job
2486,2486,Disappointing. Bland food. Prickly service.

2488,2488,Usually food is excellent and delivered in a reasonable time.
2489,2489,"though the book runs only about 300 pages , it is so densely packed ... that even an ambitious adaptation and elaborate production like mr. schepisi 's seems skimpy and unclear ."
2490,2490,Very limited menu. With all the hype I was more than disappointed. The food was not noteworthy - will not return.
2491,2491,I am not new to Chandler and needed to find a nail salon.
2492,2492,"What a change from the last time I was here, the place was absolutely barren."
2493,2493,"I won't being going back....
Pasta overcooked.
Small portions.
Too expensive.
Boring food.
Not to mention.... EMPTY RESTAURANT.

The menu looked promising.... overall... lacking in execution."
2494,2494,"The experience was excellant, would very much go again."
2495,2495,Then I was going to come back to her to frame my face with my hair dry.
2496,2496,"all 's well that ends well , and rest assured , the consciousness-raising lessons are cloaked in gross-out gags ."
2497,2497,"Over rated, over priced. Food was OK. Tables were too close"
2498,2498,"safe conduct , however ambitious and well-intentioned , fails to hit the entertainment bull 's - eye ."
2499,2499,"Suggest in the future that those without children be in one area and those that do have them along, put them in another - if possible."
2500,2500,"pryor lite , with half the demons , half the daring , much less talent , many fewer laughs ."
2501,2501,"Th food, service and drinks were exceptional."
2502,2502,let 's cut to the consumer-advice bottom line : stay home .
2503,2503,I can really appreciate courteous and conscientious co-workers after dealing with this bunch.
2504,2504,"And, it pains me to say so because I live in the neighborhood and I loved the food."
2505,2505,"this cuddly sequel to the 1999 hit is a little more visually polished , a little funnier , and a little more madcap ."
2506,2506,They are super cheap!
2507,2507,We will go back to the past next time we are in town.
2508,2508,"Michael Timothy's was far and above better than Abe and Louies, no comparison."
2509,2509,He wouldn't give up at no either.
2510,2510,"a thoughtful , moving piece that faces difficult issues with honesty and beauty ."
2511,2511,You can do better on this.
2512,2512,the piano teacher is the sort of movie that discourages american audiences from ever wanting to see another foreign film .
2513,2513,So far I'm glad I did.
2514,2514,"As always, Sarabeth's was FABULOUS! Breakfast at Sarabeth's is a must when visiting New York!"
2515,2515,Shoved the lower tier members aside.
2516,2516,I just wish I had more stomachs!
2517,2517,Hands down - the best restaurant and experience I've ever had dining.
2518,2518,So i scheduled an eye exam because i have been having headaches eye strains and dry eyes so figured it had to do with my glasses i have been wearing for the past 3-4 years.
2519,2519,Prices have been going up and down tonight.
2520,2520,It's getting smoother and harder to justify cooking anymore...
2521,2521,One thing that bothers me though is they always try to push their Macy's card.
2522,2522,Most of the meats are marinaded and are of fairly average grade. They are really tasty.
2523,2523,This is the place to go if you want to hear all the details of your nurse's private life while getting medical attention.
2524,2524,"However, I did think my halibut was slightly overcooked (underscore the word slightly) and I did not taste any truffle oil or scent."

2531,2531,Last time I went in was about a year ago and the layout was very big and open like they didn't have a lot of merchandise out on the floor.
2532,2532,"There are better places to eat in he North End, like Marco."
2533,2533,"I figured it out, shortly, on my own."
2534,2534,"at about 95 minutes , treasure planet maintains a brisk pace as it races through the familiar story ."
2535,2535,She had noticed cards on the table.
2536,2536,Too loud and rushed for a mellow evening out.
2537,2537,For the price the food was only fair. There are many restaurants that are the same money or cheaper that are better
2538,2538,... a polished and relatively sincere piece of escapism .
2539,2539,What's up with unbelievable Hickory Tavern?
2540,2540,"We finally made it there for lunch; it's impossible to get a table, and for good reason!"
2541,2541,"The room was noisier than I would have liked. I asked for the veal chop medium and it was rare toward the center; in the end I left quite a bit of it. One of my companions rated his dinner ""fair."""
2542,2542,New chef and needs time to get it right.
2543,2543,on the right track to something that 's creepy and effective ... it 's just going to take more than a man in a bullwinkle costume to get there .
2544,2544,But I honestly cannot think of one single suggestion for improvement.
2545,2545,WE didn't order from the menu and requested special pastas to be prepared.
2546,2546,One of the surprises was the naming of the boats on which the product was caught.
2547,2547,It's always nerve-wracking when you move to a new city and need to find a hairdresser.
2548,2548,Would consider going back on a special occassion but not on a regular basis as there are other restaurants with more memorable food.
2549,2549,everything that 's worthwhile about collision course can already be seen on television .
2550,2550,"*******Wish it had a small area with tables to sit and eat, (like some other locations)"
2551,2551,Finding a booth was a cinch.
2552,2552,The back room is more mellow.
2553,2553,Went here for my father-in-law's birthday celebration (his choice) less than 2 weeks ago Saturday 2/27/16.

2559,2559,We loved our lunch at Chops. The food selection and presentation was wonderful.
2560,2560,"was a good setting but staff were not very informative of menu.
And they seemed to rush to get you to eat and leave as soon as they could."
2561,2561,"I dropped it at 8 a.m. this morning, and it was finished only after 1 p.m."
2562,2562,"the movie is a blast of educational energy , as bouncy animation and catchy songs escort you through the entire 85 minutes ."
2563,2563,"all ends well , sort of , but the frenzied comic moments never click ."
2564,2564,Definitely no complaints.

2569,2569,no bueno
2570,2570,"Pasta was very good. Chicken Daviola has been over-hyped by New York Magazine, as it was nothing special."
2571,2571,Meal was disapointing as our food wasn't that good......don't know if I'd go back.
2572,2572,Me and my few friends ride our bikes downtown for get some drinks and we stop here on my home.

2579,2579,Hope more folks can go check out HolisticFit! It is a great place.
2580,2580,Bar was very poorly stocked. Two of the Scoth Whiskies on their drink menu were not available. It took ages to get our drinks served.
2581,2581,I ordered chick Pad Thai .
2582,2582,the film starts out as competent but unremarkable ... and gradually grows into something of considerable power .
2583,2583,"We frequent Rustico and the food, service is always great. Reservations are made easy through Open Table."
2584,2584,Outstanding food and service. I will return again. thanks.
